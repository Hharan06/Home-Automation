## Introduction

This project is designed to help users remotely monitor and control their home devices. By sending an SMS with its current IP address, the ESP8266 can be accessed from anywhere, facilitating a secure connection through a web interface.

## Requirements

### Hardware
- ESP8266 development board (e.g., NodeMCU, Wemos D1 Mini)
- USB cable for programming the ESP8266
- Optional: Breadboard and jumper wires for additional components

### Software
- Arduino IDE (with ESP8266 board support installed)
- Twilio account (with a verified phone number)
- A web server (optional, if you want to host a secure interface)

## Hardware Setup

1. **Connect the ESP8266** to your computer using a USB cable.
2. **Install the ESP8266 board package** in Arduino IDE:
   - Go to `File` > `Preferences`, and in the "Additional Boards Manager URLs" field, add: `http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json`
   - Open `Tools` > `Board` > `Boards Manager`, search for "ESP8266" and install it.

3. **Select the Board**:
   - Go to `Tools` > `Board`, and select your ESP8266 board.

## Software Setup

1. **Install required libraries** in Arduino IDE:
   - Go to `Sketch` > `Include Library` > `Manage Libraries`.
   - Search for and install the following libraries:
     - `ESP8266WiFi`
     - `WiFiClient`
     - `ArduinoJson` (for handling JSON, if needed)

2. **Download the provided code** (see Code Explanation section for a sample code snippet).

3. **Configure the code**:
   - Update the WiFi credentials.
   - Add your Twilio credentials (Account SID, Auth Token, and Twilio phone number).
   - Update the recipient's phone number where the IP address will be sent.

## Twilio Configuration

1. **Sign up for a Twilio account** at [Twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com/).
2. **Get a Twilio phone number**:
   - Navigate to the Phone Numbers section and buy a number.
3. **Find your Account SID and Auth Token** in the Twilio Console Dashboard.
4. **Note**: Ensure that your Twilio account is set up to send SMS messages to the phone number you want to use.

## Usage

1. Upload the code to your ESP8266.
2. Open the Serial Monitor to view the connection status and any debug messages.
3. Once connected, the device will send an SMS with its IP address to the specified recipient.

## Troubleshooting

- **WiFi Connection Issues**: Ensure that the SSID and password are correct.
- **Twilio Errors**: Check that the Account SID, Auth Token, and phone numbers are correctly set up.
- **Serial Monitor Output**: Use the Serial Monitor to debug connection issues or see the deviceâ€™s status.
